# Daily Task Repository

This repository contains my **day-wise learning tasks**.  
Each **day folder** includes multiple **sessions**, and both **days** and **sessions** have their own README files for better documentation.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Day-wise organization**  
  Each day has a dedicated folder (`day1`, `day2`, `day3`, ...).  

- **Session-wise work**  
  Inside each day, work is divided into sessions (`session_1`, `session_2`, ...).  

- **Documentation**  
  - Each **day folder** contains a `README.md` explaining the tasks completed that day.  
  - Each **session folder** also contains its own `README.md` describing session-specific exercises or notes.
